Award-Winning iOS app designed for the 2018 Dallas Regional Science &amp; Engineering Fair

  According to the Association for Safe International Road Travel (ASIRT), nearly 1.3 million people die in road accidents each year (about 3,287 deaths per day), and 20-50 million people are injured or disabled because of road hazards. To my surprise, I found that no real-time hazard reporting solution exists which public safety departments across the nation can use to clear road hazards in real time. This shocking problem, along with the near-death situation of my father and brother, motivated me to develop an iOS app to report the GPS coordinates of road hazards straight to a public safety agency like the TxDPS with just a single tap on a smartphone screen.
  I used tools like Xcode, the Swift Programming language, and several devices to develop and test my app. The app consists mainly of a real-time map view of the current location and a hazard reporting button to report GPS coordinates to a public safety server, as well as a feature to make an SOS call in case of emergency. After multiple reports of a hazard from a certain location, a staff can be sent to clear the hazard with minimal delay. Specific measures can also be taken based on collected data to improve road safety and save lives.
  In the future, I plan to present the app to the Irving City Council members with a proposal to officially launch it for City of Irving residents.
